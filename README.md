# Home Credit - Credit Risk Model Stability

This repository contains the code and documentation for our submission to the **Home Credit - Credit Risk Model Stability** Kaggle competition, conducted as part of **COS20083 Advanced Data Analytics** at Swinburne University of Technology Sarawak Campus.

---

## Objective

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a loan applicant defaulting on their credit. The key challenge is to balance predictive accuracy with long-term model stability, ensuring that performance remains robust over time.

## Project Scope

This end-to-end data science project includes:

- **Problem understanding:** Understanding credit risk assessment and scorecard stability issues
- **Data exploration (EDA):** Cleaning and transforming features, visualizing key patterns
- **Feature engineering:** Creating meaningful variables to enhance model accuracy
- **Model building:** Training various machine learning models and tuning hyperparameters
- **Model evaluation:** Assessing model performance using cross-validation and stability metrics
- **Kaggle submission:** Submitting predictions and tracking performance on the leaderboard
